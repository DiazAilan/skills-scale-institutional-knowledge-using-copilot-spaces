# OctoAcme — Retrospective & Continuous Improvement

## Purpose
Capture learnings and convert them into actionable improvements.

## When
After each sprint, release, or important milestone. Also after incidents.

## Structure
- **What went well** (all roles contribute)
- **What could be improved** (all roles contribute)
- **Action items** (owner, due date)
- **Follow-up on previous action items**

### Role-specific Retrospective Input
- **Developers**: code quality, technical debt, tooling, collaboration
- **Product Manager**: requirements clarity, prioritization effectiveness, customer value delivered
- **Project Manager**: process efficiency, communication effectiveness, risk management
- **Design Lead**: design process, UX research quality, design-dev collaboration, usability outcomes
- **QA Lead**: test coverage, bug detection timing, quality processes, testing infrastructure
- **DevOps Engineer**: deployment reliability, infrastructure performance, monitoring effectiveness, incident response
- **Business Analyst**: requirements gathering process, stakeholder alignment, data analysis quality
- **Support Lead**: customer communication effectiveness, support readiness, customer satisfaction trends

## Running a Retrospective
- Timebox: 45–75 minutes depending on team size
- Use an anonymous idea board if needed to encourage candor
- Prioritize 2–3 top action items to avoid overload

## Tracking Improvements
- Add action items to the project backlog or issues with clear owners and timelines
- Review outstanding actions in the weekly PM sync

## Example Action Item Template
- **Title**: Brief description of the improvement
- **Description**: Detailed explanation and context
- **Owner**: Person/role responsible (may be cross-role)
- **Due date**: Target completion date
- **Success criteria**: How to measure completion

### Example Action Items by Role
- **Design Lead**: "Conduct usability testing earlier in sprint to catch UX issues before development"
- **QA Lead**: "Increase automated test coverage for critical user paths from 60% to 80%"
- **DevOps Engineer**: "Reduce deployment time by 50% through pipeline optimization"
- **Business Analyst**: "Improve requirement documentation template to reduce clarification questions"
- **Support Lead**: "Create pre-release customer communication checklist to ensure consistent messaging"

## Continuous Improvement Culture
- Measure impact of action items
- Celebrate improvements and make small, iterative changes
