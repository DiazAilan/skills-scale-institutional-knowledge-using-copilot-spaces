# OctoAcme Project Management Docs

This README provides a concise overview of OctoAcme's project management approach and quick links to all process documentation in this repository's docs/ folder. It helps team members and new joiners discover and navigate program management guidance at a glance.

## Summary of OctoAcme Project Management Processes
- **Initiation**: Start with a clear problem statement, stakeholders, and measurable success criteria (Project One-pager).
- **Planning**: Break work into shippable increments with acceptance criteria, identify dependencies and risks, and align timelines and releases.
- **Execution &amp; Tracking**: Use structured team rhythms, project boards, small PRs, CI/CD, and regular demos/reviews to deliver and observe progress.
- **Risk Management &amp; Communication**: Maintain a risk register, use templates for status and incident communications, and follow defined escalation paths.
- **Release &amp; Deployment**: Follow standardized release playbooks, pre-release checks, smoke tests, and rollback plans.
- **Retrospective &amp; Continuous Improvement**: Capture learnings and convert them to prioritized action items tracked in the backlog.
- **Roles &amp; Personas**: Clear role definitions for PM, PdM, Developers, QA, and Stakeholders to reduce ambiguity.
